# pgweb2

A web PostgreSQL client for a team: browse tables, run SQL with autocomplete, manual transactions, per-user accounts and an audit log.

- [`backend/`](backend/README.md): FastAPI API (accounts, encrypted connections, queries, transactions, audit)
- [`frontend/`](frontend/README.md): React UI

## Run with Docker

```bash
export PGWEB_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
export PGWEB_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD='a long passphrase'   # 10+ characters; only used while no users exist
export PGWEB_COOKIE_SECURE=false                            # plain-http trial run only, see below
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and sign in. Then **remove the bootstrap password** from your environment and add teammates under Account menu → Team members.

| Service | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `web` | nginx: serves the built UI and proxies `/api` to `api`. The only published port (`PGWEB_PORT`, default 8080). |
| `api` | FastAPI on the internal network only. SQLite data and the encryption key live in the `api_data` volume. |

For anything beyond a trial:

- **Terminate HTTPS in front of `web`** (Caddy, a cloud load balancer, ...) and leave `PGWEB_COOKIE_SECURE` at its default `true`. Sessions are `Secure` cookies and the UI and API must share one origin. Add `Strict-Transport-Security` at that layer.
- **Set `PGWEB_SECRET_KEY`** from a secret store and back it up. It encrypts the stored database passwords; losing it makes every saved connection unreadable. (If unset, a key is generated into the volume, next to the data it protects.)
- **Set `PGWEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`** to the database hosts people may register, e.g. `["*.rds.amazonaws.com"]`.
- **Back up the `api_data` volume.**
- Don't scale `api` beyond one replica: open transactions live in its memory.
